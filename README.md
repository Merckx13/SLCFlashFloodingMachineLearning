# SLCFlashFloodingMachineLearning
Machine learning project using a random forest model to predict flash flooding

Here is the notebook for the main python script which creates a random forest model: https://github.com/darrenvc71/SLCFlashFloodingMachineLearning/blob/master/createRandomForestModel.ipynb

Based on work from @Meteorcane13, here is the early version: https://github.com/Meteorcane13/FFW_study/blob/master/FlashFloodStudy.ipynb identifying key parameters, and a latter updated version upon which this code is based: https://github.com/Meteorcane13/FFW_study/blob/master/NAM.ipynb
